A. GENERAL ADVERSE REACTIONS


A.1.	ACUTE ADVERSE REACTIONS
Definition: An adverse reaction which occurs within 1 hour of contrast agent injection.The same acute adverse reactions are seen after iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents and after ultrasound contrast agents. The incidence is highest after iodine-based contrast media and lowest after ultrasound agents. Classification Acute reactions are either allergy-like, hypersensitivity reactions or chemotoxic responses. Allergy-like reactions may or may not be true IgE mediated allergy. Hypersensitivity/ Allergy-like - Mild-Grade 1-Ring and Messmer classification: Mild urticaria, Mild itching, Erythema. Chemotoxic - Mild-Grade 1-Ring and Messmer classification: Nausea/mild vomiting, Warmth/chills, Anxiety, Vasovagal reaction which resolves spontaneously. Hypersensitivity/ Allergy-like - Moderate: Marked urticaria (Still Grade 1 Ring and Messmer), Mild bronchospasm (Grade 2), Facial/laryngeal edema (Grade 2). Chemotoxic - Moderate:  Vasovagal reaction (Grade 2). Hypersensitivity/ Allergy-like - Severe: Hypotensive shock (Grade 3), Respiratory arrest (Grade 4), Cardiac arrest (Grade 4). Chemotoxic - Severe: Arrythmia (Grade 3), Convulsion (Grade 4) Note: - •	Be aware that what at first appears to be a mild reaction may develop into a more serious reaction.•	Not all symptoms experienced by patients in the hour after contrast agent injections are adverse reactions to the contrast agent.•	Patient anxiety may cause symptoms after contrast agent administation (Lalli effect).•	When a new contrast agent is first introduced to a department, adverse effects tend to be over-reported (Weber effect).

A. GENERAL ADVERSE REACTIONS6
A.1.1.	 Acute adverse reactions to iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents Note: Retrospective studies of the incidence of acute adverse reactions suffer from considerable under-reporting and are therefore unreliable. Risk factors for acute reactions Patient relatedPatients with a history of:•	Previous moderate or severe acute reaction (see classification above) to an iodine- or gadolinium-based contrast agent.•	Asthma requiring medical treatment.•	Atopy requiring medical treatment.Contrast medium relateda) Iodine-based:•	High-osmolality ionic contrast media.•	There is no difference in the incidence of acute reactions between the non-ionic low-osmolar contrast agents and the non-ionic iso-osmolar contrast agents.•	There is no difference in the incidence of acute adverse events among the non-ionic low-osmolar agents. b) Gadolinium-based:•	The risk of a reaction is not related to the osmolality of the contrast agent: the low doses used make the osmolar load very small.•	There is no difference in the incidence of acute adverse reactions among the gadolinium-based extracellular agents.To reduce the risk of an acute reaction  to iodine- and gadolinium-based agentsFor all patients•	Use a non-ionic iodine-based contrast medium.For patients at increased risk of reaction (see risk factors above) - •	Consider an alternative test not requiring a contrast agent of similar class.•	For previous contrast agent reactors: use a different contrast agent, preferably after consultation with a specialist in drug allergy.•	Premedication is not recommended because there is not good evidence of its effectiveness Be prepared for an acute reactionFor all patients•	Have the drugs and equipment for resuscitation readily available (see A.1.2.1.).•	Keep the patient in a medical environment for 30 minutes after contrast agent injection.

Chunk 11:
A.1.2.3.
After a moderate or severe acute adverse reaction  to a contrast agent Test for evidence of allergy•	Take blood samples for estimation of histamine and tryptase at 1 and 2 hours after contrast agent administration and at 24 hours if the patient is still in the hospital.•	1 to 6 months after the reaction the patient should be referred to a specialist in drug allergy to have skin testing. Prick and intradermal tests should be used to check for evidence of true allergy to the contrast agent and for evidence of cross-reactivity to other contrast agents.•	An example of a suitable letter for the patient to take to the allergy consultation can be found in section D of these guidelines. A. GENERAL ADVERSE REACTIONS10
Record the reaction•	Record the contrast agent name and dose and the details of the reaction and its treatment in the patient’s records.•	Record the information about the reaction (see above) in the hospital adverse events register.•	If the reaction is severe or unusual, report it to the national pharmacovigilance authority.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 12:
A.1.2.4.
Review of treatment protocols Radiologists and their staff should review treatment protocols regularly (e.g. at 12 monthly intervals), so that each can accomplish their role efficiently. Knowledge, training, and preparation are crucial for guaranteeing appropriate and effective treatment if there is an adverse contrast related event.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 13:
A.1.3.
Warming iodine-based contrast medium before administration - •	Appears to make the patient more comfortable, based on clinical observation. •	Reduces viscosity and may reduce the risk of contrast medium extravasation.•	May reduce the rate of general adverse events, but data on this is limited.•	Is widely regarded as best practice.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 14:
A.1.4.
Extravascular administration of an iodine-based contrast medium - •	When absorption or leakage into the circulation is possible, take the same precautions as for intravascular administration.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 15:
A.1.5.
Fasting before administration of contrast agents Fasting before intravenous administration of contrast agents dates from the time when high-osmolar iodine-based contrast media were used and many patients vomited. Fasting is not recommended before administration of low- or iso-osmolar non-ionic iodine-based contrast media or of gadolinium-based agents.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 16:
A. GENERAL ADVERSE REACTIONS11

A.2.	LATE ADVERSE REACTIONS
DefinitionA late adverse reaction to intravascular iodine-based contrast medium is defined as a reaction which occurs 1 h to 1 week after contrast medium injection.ReactionsSkin reactions similar in type to other drug induced eruptions occur. Maculopapular rashes, erythema, swelling and pruritus are most common. Most skin reactions are mild to moderate and self-limiting. A variety of late symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, headache, musculoskeletal pains, fever) have been described following contrast medium, but many are not related to the contrast medium.Risk factors for skin reactions•	Previous late contrast medium reaction•	Interleukin-2 treatment•	Use of non-ionic dimersManagementSymptomatic and similar to the management of other drug-induced skin reactions e.g. antihistamines, topical steroids and emollients.Recommendations Patients who have had a previous contrast medium reaction, or who are on interleukin-2 treatment should be advised that a late skin reaction is possible and that they should contact a doctor if they have a problem. Patch and delayed reading intradermal tests may be useful to confirm a late skin reaction to contrast medium and to study cross-reactivity patterns with other agents. To reduce the risk of repeat reaction, use a contrast medium other than that which precipitated the first reaction. Avoid agents which have shown cross-reactivity on skin testing. Drug prophylaxis is generally not recommended. Note: Late skin reactions of the type which occur after iodine-based contrast media have not been described after gadolinium-based and ultrasound contrast media.

A.3.	VERY LATE ADVERSE REACTIONS
Definition: an adverse reaction which usually occurs more than 1 week after contrast agent injection. Type of reactionIodine-based contrast media•	ThyrotoxicosisGadolinium-based contrast agents •	Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis A.3.1.	 Very late adverse reactions to iodine-based contrast media: thyrotoxicosis At riskPatients with untreated Graves’ disease. Patients with multinodular goiter and thyroid autonomy, especially if they are elderly and/or live in an area of dietary iodine deficiency.Not at riskPatients with normal thyroid function.Recommendations Iodine-based contrast media should not be given to patients with manifest hyperthyroidism.•	In patients suspected of being at risk of thyrotoxicosis, TSH measurement may be helpful.•	In selected high-risk patients, prophylactic treatment may be given by an endocrinologist.•	Patients at risk should be closely monitored by endocrinologists after iodine-based contrast medium injection.•	Intravenous cholangiographic contrast media should not be given to patients at risk.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 18:
A. GENERAL ADVERSE REACTIONS13
A.3.2.	 Very late adverse reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents: nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) DiagnosisA diagnosis of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) should only be made if the Yale NSF Registry clinical and histopathological criteria are met (J Am Acad Dermatol 2011; 65: 1095-1106). The association between nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) and gadolinium-based contrast agents was recognized in 2006.Clinical featuresOnset can be from the day of exposure for up to 2-3 months. Rarely, it can occur years after exposure.Early changes are pain, pruritus, and swelling and erythema of the skin, which usually start in the legs.Later changes include fibrotic thickening of the skin and subcutaneous tissues and limb contractures may occur. Fibrosis of internal organs, e.g. muscle, diaphragm, heart, liver, lungs may also occur. There may be death if involvement of internal organs is severe.RISK FACTORSPatient related•	Reduced renal function, particularly if eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2.•	Patients on dialysis.Contrast agent related•	Gadodiamide was responsible for most reported NSF cases.•	NSF also occurred after gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoversetamide.•	Risk increases with increasing contrast agent dose, but NSF may occur after a single dose.Estimated incidence in patients with severe renal failure - •	3-18 % after gadodiamide.•	0.1-1 % after gadopentetate dimeglumine.

There should be at least 7 days between two injections.•	Pregnant women: these agents can be used to give essential diagnostic information.•	Lactating women: discarding the breast milk in the 24 hours after contrast medium is not considered necessary, but the patient can discuss with the doctor whether she wishes to do this.•	Laboratory testing of renal function (eGFR) is not mandatory.Recommendations for all patientsNever deny a patient a clinically well-indicated enhanced MR-examination. In all patients use the smallest amount of contrast medium necessary for a diagnostic result. Always record the name and dose of the contrast agent used in the patient records.

B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS  (POST-CONTRAST ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY, PC-AKI)

Definitions: Post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC_AKI) is defined as an increase in serum creatinine > 0.3 mg/dl (or > 26.5 µmol/l), or > 1.5 times baseline, within 48-72 hours of intravascular administration of a contrast agent. Intra-arterial injection with first pass renal exposure indicates that contrast agent reaches the renal arteries in a relatively undiluted form, e.g. injection into the left heart, thoracic and suprarenal abdominal aorta or the renal arteries. Intra-arterial injection with second pass renal exposure indicates that contrast agent reaches the renal arteries after dilution either in the pulmonary or peripheral circulation, e.g. injection into the right heart, pulmonary artery, carotid, subclavian, coronary, mesenteric or infra-renal arteries.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 22:
B.1.	MEASUREMENT OF RENAL FUNCTION
- •	Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated from the serum creatinine, is the recommended method to estimate renal function before contrast agent administration.
- •	In adults ≥ 18 years the CKD-EPI formula is recommended to calculate eGFR.
eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) = Female sCr ≤ 62 µmol/l: 144 x (sCr / 62)-0.329 x 0.993Age Female sCr > 62 µmol/l: 144 x (sCr / 62)-1.209 x 0.993Age Male sCr ≤80 µmol/l: 141 x (sCr / 80)-0.411 x 0.993Age Male sCr > 80 µmol/l: 141 x (sCr / 80)-1.209 x 0.993Age (sCr in µmol/l; age in years)	 All equations x 1.159 if African American race. - •	In children, the revised Schwartz formula is recommended to calculate eGFR
eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) = 36.5 x length / sCr	 (sCr in µmol/l; length in cm) Note: Neither serum nor plasma creatinine is an ideal indicator of renal function and may miss decreased renal function.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 25:
EMERGENCY EXAMINATION
Identify at-risk patients (see above) if possible:•	Determine eGFR if the procedure can be deferred until the result is available without harm to the patient.•	If eGFR cannot be obtained, follow the protocols for patients with eGFR less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 for intra-arterial administration with first pass renal exposure and eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 for intravenous administration and intra-arterial administration with second pass renal exposure as closely as clinical circumstances permit. B.2.2.	 Before the Examination ELECTIVE EXAMINATIONAt-risk patients  (see above)•	Consider an alternative imaging method not using iodine-based contrast media.•	Intravenous saline and bicarbonate protocols have similar efficacy for preventive hydration.•	For intravenous contrast medium and intra-arterial contrast medium administration with second pass renal exposure hydrate the patient either (a) with intravenous sodium bicarbonate 1.4 % (or 154 mmol/l in dextrose 5 % water): 3 ml/kg/h for 1 hour before contrast medium or (b) with intravenous saline 0.9 % 1 ml/kg/hr for 3-4 hours before and 4-6 hours after contrast medium.•	For intra-arterial contrast medium administration with first pass renal exposure hydrate the patient either with (a) intravenous sodium bicarbonate 1.4 % (or 154 mmol/l in dextrose 5 % water): 3 ml/kg/h for 1 hour before followed by 1 ml/kg/hr for 4-6 hours after contrast medium or (b) with intravenous saline 0.9 % for 3-4 hours before and 4-6 hours after contrast medium.•	The clinician responsible for patient care should individualize preventive hydration in patients with severe congestive heart failure (NYHA grade 3-4) or patients with end-stage renal failure (eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2).•	Oral hydration is not recommended as the sole method of preventive hydration. B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS (POST-CONTRAST ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY, PC-AKI) 19

EMERGENCY EXAMINATIONAt-risk patients  (see above)•	Consider an alternative imaging method not using iodine-based contrast media.•	Use preventive hydration before contrast medium administration (see ‚Elective examination‘ for protocols). B.2.3.	 Time of examination All patients•	Use low- or iso-osmolar contrast media.•	Use the lowest dose of contrast medium consistent with a diagnostic result.•	For intra-arterial contrast medium administration with first pass renal exposure, keep either the ratio CM dose (in gram l) / absolute eGFR (in ml/min) < 1.1 or the ratio CM volume (in ml) / eGFR (in ml/min/1.73 m2)  < 3.0, when using contrast medium concentration of 350 mgl/ml. B.2.4.	 After the Examination At-risk patients•	Continue preventive hydration if appropriate (see protocols above).•	Determine eGFR 48 hours after contrast medium administration.•	If at 48 hours there is a diagnosis of PC-AKI, monitor the patient clinically for at least 30 days and determine eGFR at regular intervals. Note: No pharmacological prophylaxis (with statins, renal vasodilators, receptor antagonists of endogenous vasoactive mediators or cytoprotective drugs) has been shown to offer consistent protection against PC-AKI. B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS (POST-CONTRAST ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY, PC-AKI) 20

B.2.5.	 Multiple myeloma patients - •	Multiple myeloma patients with normal renal function are not at increased risk of PC-AKI provided that they are well hydrated and that low- or iso-osmolar iodine-based contrast media are used.•	Multiple myeloma patients often have reduced renal function, and such patients are at increased risk of PC-AKI.•	Multiple myeloma patients often have hypercalcemia which can increase the risk of kidney damage. Correction of hypercalcemia before contrast medium administration should be discussed with the hematologist.•	Assessment for Bence Jones proteinuria before contrast medium administration is not necessary.

B.3.	RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA



MR-EXAMINATIONS
- •	The risk of PC-AKI is very low when gadolinium-based contrast agents are used in approved doses.•	In patients with reduced renal function refer to ESUR guidelines on NSF, A.3.2. RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS
- •	Gadolinium-based contrast agents are not approved for radiographic examinations.•	Gadolinium-based contrast agents should not be used for radiographic examinations in patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2).•	Gadolinium-based contrast agents are more nephrotoxic than iodine-based contrast media in equivalent X-ray attenuating doses

B.4.	PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUS TAKING METFORMIN
B.4.1.	 Iodine-based contrast media 1.	Patients with eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 and no evidence of AKI, receiving either intravenous contrast medium or intra-arterial contrast medium with second pass renal exposure: continue taking metformin normally.2.	Patients (a) with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 receiving  intravenous contrast medium, or intra-arterial contrast medium with second pass renal exposure. (b) Receiving intra-arterial contrast medium with first pass renal exposure. (c) With AKI: Stop taking metformin from the time of contrast medium administration. Measure eGFR within 48 hours and restart metformin if renal function has not changed significantly.
B.4.2.	 Gadolinium-based contrast media No special precautions are necessary when diabetic patients on metformin are given gadolinium-based contrast agents as the risk of PC-AKI is very low. B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS (POST-CONTRAST ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY, PC-AKI) 22

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 28:
B.5. DIALYSIS AND CONTRAST MEDIUM ADMINISTRATION
All iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents can be removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. However, there is no evidence that hemodialysis protects patients with impaired renal function from post contrast acute kidney injury or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. In all patients, avoid osmotic and fluid overload. To avoid the risk of NSF refer to A.3.2. PATIENTS ON DIALYSIS
Patients on hemodialysis Iodine-based contrast medium • Correlation of time of the contrast medium injection with the hemodialysis session is unnecessary. • Extra hemodialysis session to remove contrast medium is unnecessary. Gadolinium-based contrast agent • Correlation of time of the contrast agent injection with the hemodialysis session is recommended. • Extra hemodialysis session to remove contrast agent as soon as possible after it has been administered is recommended.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 29:
B.6. CAN IODINE- AND GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST AGENTS SAFELY BE GIVEN ON THE SAME DAY FOR ROUTINE EXAMINATIONS?
Efficient practice may involve giving iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents for enhanced CT and MR on the same day. To reduce any potential for nephrotoxicity the following are recommended:
1. Patients with normal renal function or moderately reduced (GFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). 75 % of both gadolinium- and iodine-based contrast agents are excreted by 4 hours after administration. There should be 4 hours between injections of iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents.
2. Patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or on dialysis). There should be 7 days between injections of iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 30:
B.7. HOW LONG SHOULD THERE BE BETWEEN TWO IODINE-BASED CONTRAST MEDIUM INJECTIONS FOR ROUTINE EXAMINATIONS?
1. Patients with normal or moderately reduced renal function (GFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). 75 % of iodine-based contrast medium is excreted by 4 hours after administration. There should be 4 hours between injections of iodine-based contrast medium.
2. Patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). There should be 48 hours between injections of iodine-based contrast medium.
3. Patients on dialysis. If there is remnant renal function, there should be at least 48 hours between injections of iodine-based contrast medium.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 31:
B.8. HOW LONG SHOULD THERE BE BETWEEN TWO GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST AGENT INJECTIONS FOR ROUTINE EXAMINATIONS?
1. Patients with normal or moderately reduced renal function (GFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). 75 % of extracellular gadolinium-based contrast agents are excreted by 4 hours after administration. There should be 4 hours between injections of gadolinium-based contrast agent.
2. Patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) or on dialysis. There should be 7 days between injections of gadolinium-based contrast agent.

C.2.	PULMONARY EFFECTS OF IODINE-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA
Pulmonary adverse effects•	Bronchospasm. •	Increased pulmonary vascular resistance.•	Pulmonary edema.Patients at high risk•	History of asthma.•	History of pulmonary hypertension.•	Incipient cardiac failure.To reduce the risk of pulmonary adverse effects - •	Use low- or iso-osmolar contrast media.•	Avoid large doses of contrast media.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 33:
C.3.	EFFECTS OF CONTRAST MEDIA ON BLOOD  AND ENDOTHELIUM
C.3.1.	 Thrombosis C.3.1.1.	Iodine-based contrast media The clinically important adverse effect of iodine-based contrast media on blood and endothelium is thrombosis.It is recognized that:•	All contrast media have anticoagulant properties, especially ionic agents.•	High-osmolar ionic contrast media may induce thrombosis due to endothelial damage, particularly in phlebographic procedures.•	Drugs and interventional devices that decrease the risk of thromboembolic complications during interventional procedures minimize the importance of the effects of contrast media. Guidelines - •	Meticulous angiographic technique is mandatory and is the most important factor in reducing thromboembolic complications.•	Low- or iso-osmolar contrast media should be used for diagnostic and interventional angiographic procedures including phlebography.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 34:
C. MISCELLANEOUS27
C.3.2.	 Sickle Cell Disease C.3.2.1.	Iodine-based contrast media - •	In patients with sickle cell disease, high-osmolar iodine-based contrast media may cause red cell sickling, leading to hemolysis and small vessel occlusion.•	Low- or iso-osmolar iodine-based contrast media produce no more adverse events in patients with sickle cell disease than in the normal population.
Guidelines - •	Use low- or iso-osmolar iodine-based contrast media.•	Hydrate patients before contrast medium administration.
C.3.2.2.	Gadolinium-based contrast media - •	The smaller doses of gadolinium-based contrast agents compared to iodine-based contrast media reduce the osmolar load, so contrast agent osmolality is unlikely to be a significant problem.•	No adverse events suggestive of red blood cell sickling have been reported after gadolinium-based contrast agents.
Guidelines - •	Use any gadolinium-based contrast agent.•	No special preparation is necessary.
C.4.

C.5.	PREGNANCY AND LACTATION
Pregnancy: Iodine-based contrast media: a) In exceptional circumstances, when radiographic examination is essential, iodine-based contrast media may be given to the pregnant female. b) Following administration of iodine-based contrast media to the mother during pregnancy, thyroid function should be checked in the neonate during the first week.  Pregnancy: Gadolinium-based contrast agents: a) When there is a very strong indication for enhanced MR, the smallest possible dose of a macrocyclic gadolinium contrast agent (see A.3.2. Agents with lowest risk of NSF) may be given to the pregnant female. b) Following administration of gadolinium-based agents to the mother during pregnancy, no neonatal tests are necessary. Lactation: Iodine-based contrast media: Breast feeding may be continued normally when iodine-based contrast media is given to the mother. Lactation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents: Breast feeding may be continued normally when macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents are given to the mother. Pregnant or lactating mother with renal impairment See renal adverse reactions (B.2.). No additional precautions are necessary for the fetus or neonate. Do not administer gadolinium-based contrast agents.

C.6.	INTERACTION WITH OTHER DRUGS AND  CLINICAL TESTS
General recommendationBe aware of the patient’s drug history.Keep a proper record of the contrast agent injection (time, dose, name).Do not mix contrast agents with other drugs in tubes and syringes. Drugs needing special attentionMetforminRefer to renal adverse reactions section (B.4.).Nephrotoxic drugsCyclosporineCisplatinAminoglycosidesNon steroid anti-inflammatory drugs Stopping nephrotoxic drugs before administering contrast agents is not generally recommended. ß-blockerß-blockers may impair the management of bronchospasm and the response to adrenaline.Interleukin-2Refer to late adverse reactions section (A.2.).Non-emergency biochemical assaysRecommendation•	Preferably collect urine and blood before administration of a contrast agent.•	In patients with normal renal function, blood can be collected 4 hours after contrast agent administration if necessary.•	In patients with reduced renal function (eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2), blood collection should be delayed for as long as possible after contrast agent administration.•	Urine collection should not be done within 24 hours of administration of a contrast agent.•	The effects of the contrast agents on the analyses may differ dependent on which analytic method is used.Isotope studies and/or treatmentThyroidPatients undergoing therapy with radioactive iodine should not have received iodine-based contrast medium for at least 2 months before treatment. Isotope imaging of the thyroid should be avoided for 2 months after iodine-based contrast medium injection.Bone, red blood cell labellingAvoid iodine-based contrast medium injection for at least 24 hours before the isotope study.

C.7.	GADOLINIUM ISSUES
C.7.1.	 Gadolinium retention in the brain C.7.1.1.	Detection - •	Seen as regions of increased signal intensity in the deep brain nuclei on unenhanced T1-weighed MR-images.•	The association between these appearances and gadolinium-based contrast agents was first noted in 2014.
C.7.1.2.	Characteristics - •	The signal intensity changes are not specific and may occur after manganese, iron, calcium etc.•	MR is less sensitive for detecting gadolinium in the brain than tissue analysis after biopsy.•	It is not known whether the deposited gadolinium is chelated.•	No neurological symptoms have yet been reported.•	The clinical significance of these changes is not yet known.•	All studies have been retrospective.•	Occurs independent of renal function.
C.7.1.3.	Relation to gadolinium-based agents - •	High signal intensity in the deep brain nuclei on MRI has been reported after all linear gadolinium-based agents, but not after macrocyclic agents.•	Analysis of brain tissue has detected gadolinium after all gadolinium-based agents with the highest levels of gadolinium in patients who had linear chelates and the lowest levels in those who had macrocyclic agents.•	The greater the previous cumulative dose of the gadolinium-based agent, the more widespread are the areas of increased signal intensity.•	Only occurs after multiple doses. C. MISCELLANEOUS31
C.7.2.	 Gadolinium retention in bone, liver and skin C.7.2.1.	Detection - •	Requires biopsy and tissue analysis.
C.7.2.2.	Characteristics - •	Occurs independent of renal function.•	May occur after any agent but greater amounts are retained after non-ionic linear agents.•	Cannot be detected by MRI.•	The amounts deposited are small but greater than in the brain.•	Bone and liver retention do not produce clinical symptoms.•	Skin deposition causes red skin plaques similar to those seen in NSF.•	Apart from NSF, the clinical consequences of bone, liver and skin deposition are unknown.
C.7.3.	 Gadolinium contamination of the environment - •	Use of gadolinium-based contrast agents for MRI has led to gadolinium reaching the environment in waste water.•	At present the amounts of gadolinium in surface and tap water are very low but they are likely to increase with increasing use of gadolinium-based contrast agents.•	The risks of this gadolinium in the environment are not yet known but there is concern that it might contribute to gadolinium deposition in human tissues.•	Monitoring of gadolinium level in the water and better water purification using reverse osmosis membranes are needed to reduce the potential for harm (see Acta Radiol 2017, 58: 259-263).

C.8.	SAFETY OF ULTRASOUND CONTRAST AGENTS
Statements•	Ultrasound contrast agents are generally safe.•	Clinical evidence of ultrasound contrast agent related events in critically ill patients and patients with acute coronary disease is limited.Contraindication•	Avoid ultrasound contrast agents in the 24 hours before extracorporeal shock wave treatment.Type and severity of reactions•	The majority of reactions are minor (e.g. headache, nausea, sensation of heat, altered taste) and self-resolving.•	More severe acute reactions are rare and are similar to those after iodine- and gadolinium-based agents (see A.1.).To reduce the risk•	Check for intolerance to any of the components of the contrast agent.•	Use the lowest level of acoustic output and shortest scanning time to allow a diagnostic examination.Treatment•	If a serious event occurs – see General adverse reaction section A.1.2.

C.9.	SAFETY OF BARIUM CONTRAST MEDIA
Statement: Contraindications: Recommended action: 1) Integrity of gut wall compromised:  Use iodine-based water-soluble contrast media. In neonates and patients at risk of leakage into mediastinum and/or lungs use low- or iso-osmolar contrast media. 2) Previous allergic reactions to barium products: Use iodine-based water-soluble contrast media and be prepared to treat a reaction. Statements: Cautions: Recommended action: Bowel strictures: Use only small amounts. Extensive colitis: Avoid barium enemas. Statements: Complications Recommended action: Reduced bowel motility: Encourage fluid intake. Venous intravasation:•	Early identification and careful observation.•	Antibiotics and intravenous fluids.•	Emergency treatment may be needed. Aspiration:•	Bronchoscopic removal for large amounts.•	Chest physiotherapy.•	Antibiotics.

C.10.	 PEDIATRIC USE OF CONTRAST AGENTS
- •	Safety considerations when using contrast media in neonates, infants and children are similar to, but not the same as, in adults.•	Contrast agent dose must be adjusted for patient age and weight.•	Age-specific normal values of serum creatinine etc. must be used.•	The revised Schwartz equation is recommended to measure eGFR (see B.1.).•	For iodine-based contrast media, non-ionic agents should be used.•	For gadolinium-based contrast agents, high-risk agents should be avoided.•	The Summary of Product Characteristics for the contrast agent should be consulted, because not all contrast agents are approved for use in children.•	If no suitable contrast agent approved for use in children is available, informed consent for off-label use must be obtained from the parents. However, if use of a specific contrast agent in children is absolutely contra-indicated, it may not be used, even with informed consent.

--------------------------------------------------

Chunk 41:
C.11.	 OFF-LABEL USE OF CONTRAST AGENTS
- •	Off-label use of diagnostic and therapeutic medication is common.•	The Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) or label should be checked to see if the proposed contrast agent use is approved for the particular patient and indication.•	Choose a contrast agent which is approved for the particular patient and indication whenever possible.•	If there is no suitable approved contrast medium, the prescriber must tell the patient about the risks and benefits of off-label contrast agent use, and must obtain the patient’s informed consent to off-label contrast agent administration.
