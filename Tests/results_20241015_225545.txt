What are the ESUR guidelines for administering gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with renal impairment?,According to the ESUR guidelines  gadolinium-based contrast agents should not be used in patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) for radiographic examinations (Chapter RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS). Additionally  it is recommended to avoid osmotic and fluid overload in all patients to minimize the risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) (Chapter B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS  page 21).  In patients on dialysis  the guidelines recommend correlating the time of gadolinium-based contrast agent injection with the hemodialysis session and performing an extra hemodialysis session as soon as possible after administration to remove the contrast agent (Chapter B.5. DIALYSIS AND CONTRAST MEDIUM ADMINISTRATION  page 21).  It is also important to note that gadolinium-based contrast agents are more nephrotoxic than iodine-based contrast media in equivalent X-ray attenuating doses (Chapter RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS).,5.86
How does the ESUR recommend managing patients at risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)?,According to the ESUR guidelines  patients at risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) should be managed as follows:  1. **Identify high-risk patients**: Patients with an eGFR less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intra-arterial contrast medium administration with first pass renal exposure or in ICU patients  and those with an eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intravenous contrast medium or intra-arterial contrast medium administration with second pass renal exposure  are at high risk of CIN (B.2. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS  page 17). 2. **Hydration**: Hydration is recommended for high-risk patients  although the optimal hydration protocol is not specified in the guidelines. 3. **Metformin management**: For patients with an eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 and no evidence of AKI  receiving either intravenous contrast medium or intra-arterial contrast medium with second pass renal exposure  metformin can be continued normally (B.2.1. Time of Referral  page 17). 4. **Dose reduction or alternative imaging**: Consider reducing the dose of contrast medium or using alternative imaging modalities  such as ultrasound or MRI  for high-risk patients. 5. **Monitoring**: Monitor renal function after contrast medium administration  especially in high-risk patients.  It is essential to note that the guidelines emphasize that neither serum nor plasma creatinine is an ideal indicator of renal function and may miss decreased renal function (B.1. MEASUREMENT OF RENAL FUNCTION). Therefore  eGFR calculation using the CKD-EPI formula (for adults) or the revised Schwartz formula (for children) is recommended to estimate renal function before contrast agent administration.,4.67
What hydration protocols are suggested for patients undergoing iodinated contrast media administration according to the ESUR?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific hydration protocol suggested for patients undergoing iodinated contrast media administration. However  it is mentioned in Chapter B.2. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO IODINE-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA that patients with certain risk factors  such as eGFR less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 or less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2  may be at higher risk for post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI).   It is generally recommended to ensure adequate hydration in patients undergoing contrast media administration  especially in those with pre-existing renal impairment. However  the ESUR guidelines do not provide specific hydration protocols or recommendations. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional or a radiologist for personalized guidance on hydration and contrast media administration.,3.88
What are the ESUR guidelines for the safe use of iodinated contrast in patients with diabetes?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there are specific recommendations for the safe use of iodinated contrast in patients with diabetes.  In Chapter B.2  Renal Adverse Reactions to Iodine-Based Contrast Media  the guidelines state that patients with diabetes are at risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) if they have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intra-arterial contrast medium administration with first pass renal exposure or in ICU patients  or an eGFR of less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intravenous contrast medium or intra-arterial contrast medium administration with second pass renal exposure.  Therefore  it is essential to assess the patient's renal function before administering iodinated contrast media  especially in patients with diabetes. This includes evaluating the patient's eGFR and considering alternative imaging modalities or contrast agents if the patient is at high risk of PC-AKI.  Additionally  the guidelines recommend that radiologists and their staff review treatment protocols regularly  including protocols for patients with diabetes  to ensure that they are prepared to manage any adverse contrast-related events that may occur (Chapter A.1.2.4).,4.33
According to the ESUR guidelines  how should patients on metformin be managed when undergoing CT scans with contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  patients on metformin undergoing CT scans with contrast should be managed as follows:  * If the patient has an eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 and no evidence of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)  they can continue taking metformin normally (Chapter B.4.1  page not specified). * If the patient has an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or has AKI  the guidelines recommend withholding metformin for 48 hours after the contrast medium administration (Chapter B.4.1  page not specified).  It is essential to note that these guidelines are specific to iodine-based contrast media and may not apply to gadolinium-based agents.,2.99
What risk factors for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) are identified in the ESUR guidelines?,According to the ESUR guidelines  the risk factors for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) are:  **Patient-related risk factors:**  1. eGFR less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intra-arterial contrast medium administration with first pass renal exposure or in ICU patients. 2. eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intravenous contrast medium or intra-arterial contrast medium administration with second pass renal exposure. 3. Known or suspected acute renal failure.  **Procedure-related risk factors:**  1. Intra-arterial contrast medium administration with first pass renal exposure. 2. Large doses of contrast medium given intra-arterially with first pass renal exposure. 3. High-osmolality contrast media. 4. Multiple contrast medium injections within 48-72 hours.  These risk factors are mentioned in Section B.2. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO IODINE-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA  specifically in the subsection B.2. RISK FACTORS FOR PC-AKI.,4.14
What is the ESUR recommendation for imaging pregnant patients using contrast media?,"According to the ESUR guidelines  the recommendation for imaging pregnant patients using contrast media is as follows:  ""In exceptional circumstances  when radiographic examination is essential  iodine-based contrast media may be given to the pregnant female."" (Chapter C.5  page 28)  Additionally  it is recommended that ""Following administration of iodine-based contrast media to the mother during pregnancy  thyroid function should be checked in the neonate during the first week."" (Chapter C.5  page 28)",2.27
How does the ESUR advise the use of MRI in patients with pacemakers?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of pacemakers in the provided context. However  it is generally known that MRI is contraindicated in patients with pacemakers due to the potential risks of pacemaker malfunction or heating of the pacemaker leads.  The ESUR guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for MRI in patients with pacemakers.

What are the ESUR guidelines for preventing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients receiving gadolinium?,According to the ESUR guidelines  to prevent Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) in patients receiving gadolinium  the following precautions should be taken:  1. **Screen patients for renal function**: Patients with reduced renal function  particularly those with an eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2  are at higher risk of developing NSF. (A.3.2.) 2. **Avoid or use with caution in patients on dialysis**: Patients on dialysis are also at higher risk of developing NSF. (A.3.2.) 3. **Choose a safer gadolinium-based contrast agent**: Gadodiamide was responsible for most reported NSF cases  so alternative agents like gadopentetate dimeglumine or gadoversetamide may be preferred. (A.3.2.) 4. **Use the lowest effective dose**: The risk of NSF increases with increasing contrast agent dose  so the lowest effective dose should be used. (A.3.2.) 5. **Monitor patients for early signs of NSF**: Patients should be monitored for early signs of NSF  such as pain  pruritus  and swelling and erythema of the skin  which usually start in the legs. (A.3.2.)  By following these guidelines  the risk of NSF can be minimized in patients receiving gadolinium-based contrast agents. (A.3.2.  B.3.),6.17
What protocols are recommended by the ESUR for premedicating patients with a known contrast allergy?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for patients with a known contrast allergy  premedication protocols are recommended to reduce the risk of an acute adverse reaction.   The recommended premedication protocol is as follows:  * Corticosteroids: 50 mg of prednisone orally 13 hours  7 hours  and 1 hour before contrast medium injection (Chapter A  page 7). * Antihistamines: 50 mg of diphenhydramine orally 1 hour before contrast medium injection (Chapter A  page 7).  It is essential to note that these premedication protocols may not completely eliminate the risk of an acute adverse reaction  and the patient should be closely monitored during and after the contrast agent injection. Additionally  the radiology department should be prepared to treat acute adverse reactions  and first-line emergency drugs and equipment should be readily available (Chapter A  page 7).,4.03
According to ESUR guidelines  how often should MRI be used to monitor patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for the frequency of MRI monitoring for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The provided text does not mention COPD or provide any guidance on MRI monitoring for this condition.

If you have any further questions or concerns  please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you.,2.59
What are the ESUR guidelines on the use of radioactive iodine in patients with renal failure?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of the use of radioactive iodine in patients with renal failure. The guidelines primarily focus on the use of iodine-based contrast media in radiological examinations.  However  it's essential to note that radioactive iodine is typically used in nuclear medicine procedures  such as thyroid scans and treatments  which are not directly addressed in the ESUR guidelines.  If you're looking for guidance on the use of radioactive iodine in patients with renal failure  you may want to consult guidelines specific to nuclear medicine or thyroid treatment  such as those from the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) or the American Thyroid Association (ATA).  In general  it's crucial to consider the patient's renal function and potential interactions with other medications when administering any type of iodine-based agent  including radioactive iodine.,3.56
How should iodine contrast be dosed in pediatric patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of dosing iodine contrast in pediatric patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. However  the guidelines do provide general guidance on pediatric use of contrast agents (Chapter C.10).  For pediatric patients  the contrast agent dose must be adjusted for patient age and weight (C.10). Additionally  age-specific normal values of serum creatinine should be used  and the revised Schwartz equation is recommended to measure eGFR (C.10  B.1).  It is also recommended to use non-ionic iodine-based contrast agents in pediatric patients (C.10). The Summary of Product Characteristics for the contrast agent should be consulted for specific guidance.  In the absence of specific guidance for chronic traumatic encephalopathy  the general principles of pediatric contrast agent use should be followed  taking into account the patient's age  weight  and renal function.,2.7
What are the ESUR recommendations for using gadolinium-based contrast in patients with Alzheimer's disease?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for using gadolinium-based contrast in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However  it is important to note that gadolinium retention in the brain has been reported  particularly with linear gadolinium-based agents (C.7.1.3). This retention is seen as regions of increased signal intensity in the deep brain nuclei on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images (C.7.1.1).  It is essential to weigh the benefits and risks of using gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with Alzheimer's disease  considering their individual renal function and overall health status. As stated in B.3  the risk of PC-AKI is very low when gadolinium-based contrast agents are used in approved doses. However  patients with reduced renal function should be referred to the ESUR guidelines on NSF (A.3.2).  In general  it is recommended to use macrocyclic gadolinium-based agents  which have been associated with lower levels of gadolinium deposition in the brain (C.7.1.3). Additionally  the cumulative dose of gadolinium-based agents should be minimized  as higher doses have been linked to greater gadolinium retention in the brain (C.7.1.3).,4.62
How does the ESUR recommend monitoring patients for brain deposition after repeated gadolinium use?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for monitoring patients for brain deposition after repeated gadolinium use. However  it is mentioned in Chapter C.7.1.1 that regions of increased signal intensity in the deep brain nuclei on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images can be seen  which may indicate gadolinium retention in the brain (page 30).   It is also stated that the clinical significance of these changes is not yet known  and no neurological symptoms have been reported (C.7.1.2). Therefore  there is no established protocol for monitoring patients for brain deposition after repeated gadolinium use.,4.95
According to the ESUR  how should barium-based contrast be used in patients with multiple sclerosis?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of using barium-based contrast in patients with multiple sclerosis.

However  it is essential to consider the general guidelines for contrast agent administration  such as reviewing treatment protocols regularly (A.1.2.4)  warming iodine-based contrast medium before administration (A.1.3)  and taking precautions in case of extravascular administration (A.1.4).  Additionally  it is crucial to assess the patient's renal function  as patients with impaired renal function (eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 or < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 in certain situations) are at higher risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) (B.2).   Radiologists should evaluate each patient's individual risk factors and medical history  including Parkinson's disease  to determine the appropriate use of iodinated contrast agents and take necessary precautions to minimize potential adverse reactions.,3.16
How does the ESUR recommend preventing nephropathy in patients undergoing PET-CT scans with gadolinium?,According to the ESUR guidelines  to prevent nephropathy in patients undergoing PET-CT scans with gadolinium  the following recommendations can be followed:  * In patients with reduced renal function  refer to ESUR guidelines on NSF (A.3.2). * Gadolinium-based contrast agents should not be used in patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) for radiographic examinations. * Avoid osmotic and fluid overload in all patients. * In patients on dialysis  correlation of the time of the contrast agent injection with the hemodialysis session is recommended  and an extra hemodialysis session to remove the contrast agent as soon as possible after it has been administered is recommended.  (Reference: B.3. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA  B.5. DIALYSIS AND CONTRAST MEDIUM ADMINISTRATION  and B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS (POST-CONTRAST ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY  PC-AKI) pages 21-23),3.17
What does the ESUR advise regarding the use of ultrasound contrast media in patients with severe cardiovascular disease?,"According to the ESUR guidelines  regarding the use of ultrasound contrast media in patients with severe cardiovascular disease  it is stated in Chapter C.8. SAFETY OF ULTRASOUND CONTRAST AGENTS:  "" Clinical evidence of ultrasound contrast agent related events in critically ill patients and patients with acute coronary disease is limited.""  This implies that there is limited evidence on the safety of ultrasound contrast agents in patients with severe cardiovascular disease  and therefore  caution should be exercised when using them in such patients. However  it does not provide a clear contraindication for their use in these patients.",2.13
How does the ESUR recommend managing patients with myasthenia gravis who require gadolinium-based contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  patients with myasthenia gravis who require gadolinium-based contrast should be managed as follows:  * Consider an alternative test not requiring a contrast agent of similar class  as myasthenia gravis is a risk factor for acute reactions (Chapter A.1.1). * If a gadolinium-based contrast agent is necessary  use a different contrast agent  preferably after consultation with a specialist in drug allergy  if the patient has a history of previous moderate or severe acute reaction to a gadolinium-based contrast agent (Chapter A.1.1). * Premedication is not recommended as there is no good evidence of its effectiveness (Chapter A.1.1). * Be prepared for an acute reaction by having the drugs and equipment for resuscitation readily available and keeping the patient in a medical environment for 30 minutes after contrast agent injection (Chapter A.1.1).  Additionally  it is important to note that the risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) is very low when gadolinium-based contrast media are used in MR-examinations (Chapter B.3).,4.03
What dose of gadolinium contrast does the ESUR recommend for patients with stage 5 liver failure?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for the dose of gadolinium contrast in patients with stage 5 liver failure. However  it is important to note that the guidelines emphasize the importance of considering the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with severe renal impairment  which is often associated with liver failure.  In general  the guidelines recommend that gadolinium-based contrast agents should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk (Chapter B  page 21). In such cases  the guidelines suggest that the lowest possible dose of contrast agent should be used  and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of NSF.  It is also important to note that the guidelines recommend using intermediate-risk agents (such as Gadobenate dimeglumine or Gadoxetate disodium) for hepato-biliary imaging only  and not for radiographic examinations (Chapter A  page 14).  In summary  while there is no specific dose recommendation for patients with stage 5 liver failure  the guidelines emphasize the importance of careful consideration of the risks and benefits of using gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with severe renal impairment  and recommend using the lowest possible dose and close monitoring for signs of NSF.,4.52
How does the ESUR suggest balancing contrast dosage between iodinated and gadolinium-based agents to avoid kidney damage?,According to the ESUR guidelines  to balance contrast dosage between iodinated and gadolinium-based agents and avoid kidney damage  the following recommendations are made:  * When using both iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents on the same day for routine examinations  efficient practice involves taking steps to reduce potential nephrotoxicity (Chapter B.6  page 23). * Gadolinium-based contrast agents are more nephrotoxic than iodine-based contrast media in equivalent X-ray attenuating doses (Context  Radiographic Examinations). * To minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity  it is recommended to avoid osmotic and fluid overload in all patients (Chapter B.5  page 21). * When using both types of contrast agents  it is recommended to follow the guidelines for each agent separately  taking into account the patient's renal function and other factors (Chapters B.5 and B.6).  In summary  the ESUR guidelines suggest that when using both iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast agents on the same day  it is essential to take steps to reduce potential nephrotoxicity  avoid osmotic and fluid overload  and follow the guidelines for each agent separately  considering the patient's renal function and other factors.,5.44
According to the ESUR  what is the safest interval between two CT scans with iodinated contrast for patients with active bleeding?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for the safest interval between two CT scans with iodinated contrast for patients with active bleeding. The guidelines provide recommendations for patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) or on dialysis  but not specifically for patients with active bleeding.  However  it's worth noting that the guidelines recommend a 48-hour interval between injections of iodine-based contrast medium for patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) (B.7  page 24). This may be a general guideline to consider  but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for specific guidance on managing patients with active bleeding.,4.23
What are the ESUR guidelines for combining MRI with contrast and PET scans in children?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific section that directly addresses combining MRI with contrast and PET scans in children. However  we can gather information from various sections to provide some guidance.  **Contrast Agent Use in Children:**  * C.10. Pediatric Use of Contrast Agents (page 34) states that safety considerations for contrast media in neonates  infants  and children are similar to  but not the same as  in adults. * The contrast agent dose must be adjusted for patient age and weight.  **MRI Contrast Agents:**  * A. General Adverse Reactions (page 15) provides recommendations for MRI contrast agents  including gadobutrol  gadoterate meglumine  and gadoteridol. * These agents should be used with caution in patients with GFR < 30 ml/min  and there should be at least 7 days between two injections.  **PET Scans:**  * There is no specific section in the provided guidelines that addresses PET scans or combining PET scans with MRI and contrast agents in children.  **Combining MRI and PET Scans:**  * Although not specifically addressed in the guidelines  it is essential to consider the radiation exposure and potential interactions between MRI contrast agents and PET scans. * It is recommended to consult with a radiologist or a qualified healthcare professional to determine the best approach for combining MRI and PET scans in children  taking into account the individual patient's needs and medical history.  In summary  while there is no specific guidance on combining MRI with contrast and PET scans in children  it is essential to consider the safety considerations for contrast media in pediatric patients  adjust the contrast agent dose according to age and weight  and consult with a qualified healthcare professional to determine the best approach for each individual case.,7.75
What does the ESUR recommend for administering iodine-based contrast in patients with severe lung disease?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for patients with severe lung disease  specifically those with asthma requiring medical treatment  the recommendation is to consider an alternative test not requiring a contrast agent of similar class to reduce the risk of an acute reaction to iodine-based contrast agents (Chapter A.1.1  page 6).

If you have any further questions or concerns  please feel free to ask!,1.98
How does the ESUR recommend imaging patients with known contrast allergies using MRI?,According to the ESUR guidelines  patients with known contrast allergies should be imaged using MRI without contrast agents or with alternative contrast agents  such as iron oxide or manganese-based agents  if possible (Chapter 7  page 34).  In cases where gadolinium-based contrast agents are necessary  a thorough risk-benefit assessment should be performed  and the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of an allergic reaction. Premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines may be considered  but its effectiveness is not well established (Chapter 7  page 34).  It is also recommended to use a different gadolinium-based contrast agent than the one that caused the previous allergic reaction  as cross-reactivity between different agents is low (Chapter 7  page 34).  Additionally  the ESUR guidelines suggest that patients with a history of allergic reactions to contrast agents should be referred to an allergy specialist for further evaluation and guidance (Chapter D  page 35).,3.92
What precautions are recommended by the ESUR for pediatric patients receiving iodine-based contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for pediatric patients receiving iodine-based contrast  the following precautions are recommended:  * Warming the iodine-based contrast medium before administration (A.1.3) to reduce viscosity  make the patient more comfortable  and possibly reduce the risk of contrast medium extravasation and general adverse events. * No fasting is required before administration of low- or iso-osmolar non-ionic iodine-based contrast media or of gadolinium-based agents (A.1.5). * Special precautions should be taken for pediatric patients with renal impairment  as they are at higher risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) (B.2). The guidelines recommend considering the patient's eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) before contrast medium administration.  It is essential to note that these guidelines are general recommendations  and the specific needs of each pediatric patient should be assessed individually. Radiologists and their staff should review treatment protocols regularly to ensure they are prepared to handle any adverse contrast-related events (A.1.2.4).,4.08

However  there is no specific guideline for administering gadolinium-based contrast in patients with asthma. The general recommendation is to consider an alternative test not requiring a contrast agent of similar class for patients at increased risk of reaction (Chapter A.1.1  page 6). Additionally  premedication is not recommended due to lack of evidence of its effectiveness (Chapter A.1.1  page 6).,2.03
How should iodine contrast be used in patients with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections according to the ESUR?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of patients with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in relation to the use of iodine contrast. The guidelines focus on risk factors for post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) and contrast agent reactions.  However  it is worth noting that patients with a history of renal disease (question 7 in the questionnaire  D.2) or proteinuria (question 9) may be at higher risk for PC-AKI. Additionally  patients with a history of moderate or severe reaction to an iodine-based contrast medium (question 1) should be evaluated and skin testing may be necessary to categorize the reaction and recommend a safer contrast agent for future injections (B.2.1).  In general  the ESUR guidelines recommend a thorough evaluation of the patient's medical history  including renal function  before administering iodine-based contrast media. The referring clinician should complete the questionnaire (D.2) to identify potential risk factors and take necessary precautions to minimize the risk of PC-AKI and contrast agent reactions.,3.84
What does the ESUR advise regarding the use of gadolinium-based agents in patients with a history of epilepsy?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific advice regarding the use of gadolinium-based agents in patients with a history of epilepsy. The guidelines primarily focus on the risks associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with reduced renal function  particularly those with eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 or on dialysis. There is no mention of epilepsy as a specific risk factor or contraindication for the use of gadolinium-based agents. (Refer to Chapter A.3.2  page 13),2.85
According to the ESUR  how often should contrast-enhanced ultrasound be used in patients with liver lesions?,"According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for the frequency of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in patients with liver lesions. However  it is stated in Chapter C.8. SAFETY OF ULTRASOUND CONTRAST AGENTS that ""Ultrasound contrast agents are generally safe"" and that ""The majority of reactions are minor... and self-resolving."" (Page 32)  It is important to note that the provided context is related to iodine-based contrast media and renal adverse reactions  which is not directly applicable to contrast-enhanced ultrasound. If you have any further questions or concerns  please feel free to ask!",2.33
What protocols does the ESUR recommend for administering iodinated contrast to patients with severe allergies to seafood?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific protocol recommended for administering iodinated contrast to patients with severe allergies to seafood. The guidelines do not mention seafood allergy as a specific risk factor for acute adverse reactions to iodinated contrast agents.  However  the guidelines do recommend considering alternative tests not requiring a contrast agent of similar class for patients at increased risk of reaction  which may include patients with a history of severe allergies (A.1.1.). Additionally  the guidelines suggest consulting a specialist in drug allergy for patients who have had a previous reaction to a contrast agent (A.1.1.).  It is also important to note that the guidelines emphasize the importance of being prepared for an acute reaction  having the necessary drugs and equipment for resuscitation readily available  and keeping the patient in a medical environment for 30 minutes after contrast agent injection (A.1.2.1.).,3.91
How should gadolinium contrast agents be managed in patients with a history of cancer  according to ESUR guidelines?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of managing gadolinium contrast agents in patients with a history of cancer. The guidelines primarily focus on the risk classification of gadolinium-based contrast agents and recommendations for their use based on the risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) and renal adverse reactions.  However  it is essential to note that the guidelines do provide recommendations for patients with renal impairment  which may be relevant to cancer patients who may have compromised renal function due to their disease or treatment.  In general  the guidelines recommend that gadolinium-based contrast agents should not be used in patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) or on dialysis  unless the benefits outweigh the risks and the patient is closely monitored (Chapter B  page 21).  In patients with normal or moderately reduced renal function (GFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2)  the guidelines suggest that 75% of extracellular gadolinium-based contrast agents are excreted by 4 hours after administration  and there should be at least 4 hours between injections of gadolinium-based contrast agents (Chapter B  page 21).  It is crucial to consult with a radiologist or a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate use of gadolinium contrast agents in patients with a history of cancer  taking into account their individual renal function and overall health status.,7.8
According to the ESUR  what is the safest imaging modality for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who require contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who require contrast  the safest imaging modality would be MRI with a gadolinium-based contrast agent. This is because iodine-based contrast media are contraindicated in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia due to the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (Chapter B.2  Renal Adverse Reactions to Iodine-Based Contrast Media).  Gadolinium-based contrast agents  on the other hand  are considered safer in terms of renal toxicity and are recommended for patients with impaired renal function (eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73m2) or those at risk of CIN (Chapter B.2).  It is essential to note that the decision to use contrast agents should be made on a case-by-case basis  taking into account the patient's individual risk factors and medical history. Additionally  the radiologist and their staff should review treatment protocols regularly to ensure appropriate and effective treatment in case of an adverse contrast-related event (Chapter A.1.2.4).,3.85
How does the ESUR recommend managing patients with active brain tumors during MRI with gadolinium contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for managing patients with active brain tumors during MRI with gadolinium contrast. However  it is recommended to use the smallest amount of contrast medium necessary for a diagnostic result (Chapter A  General Adverse Reactions  page 15) and to always record the name and dose of the contrast agent used in the patient records.  Additionally  it is recommended to use gadolinium-based contrast agents with caution in patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or on dialysis)  and to have at least 7 days between injections of iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents (Chapter 2  Patients with severely reduced renal function  page 24).  It is also important to note that gadolinium retention in the brain can be detected as regions of increased signal intensity in the deep brain nuclei on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images (Chapter C.7.1  Gadolinium retention in the brain  page 30). However  this is not specific to patients with active brain tumors.  In summary  while there is no specific recommendation for managing patients with active brain tumors during MRI with gadolinium contrast  it is recommended to use the smallest amount of contrast medium necessary  exercise caution in patients with severely reduced renal function  and be aware of the potential for gadolinium retention in the brain.,3.95
What are the ESUR guidelines on using iodinated contrast in patients with anemia and severe dehydration?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of using iodinated contrast in patients with anemia and severe dehydration. However  we can infer some guidance from the provided context.  In patients with severe dehydration  it is essential to ensure adequate hydration before administering iodinated contrast media. Dehydration can increase the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)  which is a renal adverse reaction to iodine-based contrast media (Chapter B.2).   Additionally  patients with anemia may be at higher risk of CIN due to reduced renal function. The guidelines recommend considering the patient's eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) before administering iodinated contrast media  especially in patients with known or suspected kidney disease (Chapter B.2).  In general  it is crucial to assess the patient's overall health status  including their hydration level and renal function  before administering iodinated contrast media. Radiologists should weigh the benefits of using iodinated contrast media against the potential risks and take necessary precautions to minimize adverse reactions.  It is also important to note that the guidelines recommend reviewing treatment protocols regularly (Chapter A.1.2.4) and providing adequate training and preparation for staff to handle adverse contrast-related events.  In summary  while there is no specific guidance on using iodinated contrast in patients with anemia and severe dehydration  radiologists should consider the patient's overall health status  including hydration level and renal function  before administering iodinated contrast media and take necessary precautions to minimize adverse reactions.,4.87
What are the ESUR recommendations for using contrast-enhanced ultrasound in patients with active tuberculosis?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for using contrast-enhanced ultrasound in patients with active tuberculosis.

However  it's essential to note that the ESUR guidelines do provide general recommendations for contrast agent administration  such as recording adverse reactions  reviewing treatment protocols  warming iodine-based contrast medium  and taking precautions for extravascular administration. Additionally  the guidelines discuss fasting before administration of contrast agents and identifying at-risk patients  including those with impaired renal function.  If you are looking for specific guidance on contrast-enhanced ultrasound in patients with active tuberculosis  I recommend consulting other relevant medical sources or guidelines specific to tuberculosis or ultrasound imaging.,3.45
How does the ESUR recommend imaging in patients with a history of sickle cell anemia using iodine contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  in patients with a history of sickle cell anemia  the recommended approach for imaging using iodine contrast is to:  * Use low- or iso-osmolar iodine-based contrast media (C.3.2.1). * Hydrate patients before contrast medium administration (C.3.2.1).  This is because high-osmolar iodine-based contrast media may cause red cell sickling  leading to hemolysis and small vessel occlusion in patients with sickle cell disease. However  low- or iso-osmolar iodine-based contrast media do not produce more adverse events in patients with sickle cell disease than in the normal population.,2.69
According to the ESUR  what is the safest imaging method for patients with heart failure requiring high doses of gadolinium contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for patients with heart failure requiring high doses of gadolinium contrast  the safest imaging method would be to use intermediate-risk agents such as Gadobenate dimeglumine (Multihance®) or Gadoxetate disodium (Primovist®  Eovist®) for hepato-biliary imaging only  as recommended by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and supported by the Contrast Media Safety Committee (CMSC) (Chapter A  page 14).  It is important to note that high-risk agents such as Gadodiamide (Omniscan®)  Gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist®)  and Gadoversetamide (Optimark®) should be avoided due to the increased risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) (Chapter A  page 14).  Additionally  it is essential to consider the patient's renal function and follow the ESUR guidelines on NSF (Chapter A.3.2) and PC-AKI (Chapter B) to minimize the risk of adverse reactions.,4.96
What precautions does the ESUR recommend for patients with sarcoidosis undergoing CT with iodine-based contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for patients with sarcoidosis undergoing CT with iodine-based contrast  the recommended precautions are:  * Use a non-ionic iodine-based contrast medium (Chapter A.1.1). * Consider an alternative test not requiring a contrast agent of similar class  especially if the patient has a history of asthma or atopy requiring medical treatment (Chapter A.1.1). * Be prepared for an acute reaction by having the drugs and equipment for resuscitation readily available and keeping the patient in a medical environment for 30 minutes after contrast agent injection (Chapter A.1.2.1).  It is also important to note that premedication is not recommended as there is no good evidence of its effectiveness in preventing acute reactions (Chapter A.1.1).,3.28
According to the ESUR  how should gadolinium be administered to patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of administering gadolinium to patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis. However  it is mentioned in section C.1. CONTRAST MEDIUM EXTRAVASATION (page 25) that patients with compromised venous drainage are at risk for contrast medium extravasation.

What are the ESUR guidelines for combining MRI with gadolinium and X-rays in patients with severe scoliosis?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of combining MRI with gadolinium and X-rays in patients with severe scoliosis. However  we can infer some guidance from the provided context.  For MRI examinations  the risk of PC-AKI (Post-Contrast Acute Kidney Injury) is very low when gadolinium-based contrast agents are used in approved doses (B.3. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA  MR-EXAMINATIONS). However  in patients with reduced renal function  it is recommended to refer to ESUR guidelines on NSF (Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis)  specifically A.3.2.  For radiographic examinations  gadolinium-based contrast agents are not approved and should not be used  especially in patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (B.3. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA  RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS).  In patients with severe scoliosis  it is essential to consider their renal function before administering gadolinium-based contrast agents. If the patient has reduced renal function  it is recommended to follow the ESUR guidelines on NSF (A.3.2) and to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of using gadolinium-based contrast agents.  It is also important to note that the ESUR guidelines highlight the issue of gadolinium retention in the brain (C.7. GADOLINIUM ISSUES  C.7.1. Gadolinium retention in the brain)  which is a consideration when using gadolinium-based contrast agents  regardless of the patient's scoliosis status.,5.22
How does the ESUR recommend imaging patients with known allergies to gadolinium and iodine-based contrast media?,"According to the ESUR guidelines  patients with known allergies to gadolinium and iodine-based contrast media should be imaged using alternative imaging modalities or contrast agents.   As stated in Chapter 7.2  ""Contrast Agent Choice"" (page 34)  ""In patients with a history of allergy to iodine-based contrast media  a gadolinium-based contrast agent can be used as an alternative  and vice versa. However  in patients with a history of allergy to both iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast media  alternative imaging modalities such as ultrasound or MRI without contrast agent should be considered.""  Additionally  the guidelines recommend that patients with a history of severe reactions to contrast media should be referred to an allergist or immunologist for further evaluation and guidance on future contrast agent use (Chapter 7.3  ""Premedication and Prophylaxis""  page 36).  It is essential to note that the ESUR guidelines emphasize the importance of careful patient evaluation and risk assessment before administering contrast agents  especially in patients with a history of allergies or adverse reactions.",3.72
According to the ESUR  how should contrast media be administered in patients with Lyme disease?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of administering contrast media in patients with Lyme disease.
