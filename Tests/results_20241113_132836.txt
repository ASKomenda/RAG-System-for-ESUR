What are the ESUR guidelines for administering gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with renal impairment?,According to the ESUR guidelines  gadolinium-based contrast agents should not be used in patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) for radiographic examinations (Chapter: RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS). Additionally  it is recommended to avoid osmotic and fluid overload in all patients to minimize the risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) (Chapter: B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS  page 21).  In patients on dialysis  the guidelines recommend correlating the time of gadolinium-based contrast agent injection with the hemodialysis session and performing an extra hemodialysis session as soon as possible after administration to remove the contrast agent (Chapter: B.5. DIALYSIS AND CONTRAST MEDIUM ADMINISTRATION  page 21).  It is also important to note that gadolinium-based contrast agents are more nephrotoxic than iodine-based contrast media in equivalent X-ray attenuating doses (Chapter: RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS).,"{""context_relevant"": ""Yes""  ""question_answered_fully"": ""Yes""  ""used_context_chunks"": [0  1]}","Here is the enhanced answer with citations:  According to the ESUR guidelines  ""Gadolinium-based contrast agents should not be used for radiographic examinations in patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2)"" [Chunk 0].

However  these recommendations do not apply to barium  which is a different type of contrast agent used in radiological examinations such as barium swallows  enemas  and upper GI series.  In fact  the guidelines explicitly state that iodine-based water-soluble contrast media should be used in certain situations  such as when the integrity of the gut wall is compromised [Chunk 0]  or in patients with previous allergic reactions to barium products [Chunk 0]. This further supports the notion that barium is not addressed in the context of nephropathy management.  Therefore  the ESUR guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for managing patients with nephropathy following contrast administration using barium.,,11.39

What are the ESUR guidelines for using iodine-based contrast in patients with end-stage liver failure?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of using iodine-based contrast in patients with end-stage liver failure. However  it is essential to consider the patient's renal function  as liver failure often coexists with renal impairment.  In patients with impaired renal function  the risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) increases. The guidelines recommend considering the following risk factors for PC-AKI:  * eGFR less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intra-arterial contrast medium administration with first pass renal exposure or in ICU patients. * eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intravenous contrast medium or intra-arterial contrast medium administration with second pass renal exposure. (B.2. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO IODINE-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA)  In patients with end-stage liver failure  it is crucial to assess their renal function and consider the potential risks of PC-AKI before administering iodine-based contrast media. Additionally  radiologists should review treatment protocols regularly to ensure they are prepared to manage any adverse contrast-related events (A.1.2.4).  It is also important to note that warming iodine-based contrast medium before administration is widely regarded as best practice  as it may reduce the risk of contrast medium extravasation and make the patient more comfortable (A.1.3).,"{""context_relevant"": ""Yes""  ""question_answered_fully"": ""No""  ""used_context_chunks"": [0  1  2  4]}",According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of using iodine-based contrast in patients with end-stage liver failure. However  it is essential to consider the patient's overall health status  including their liver function  before administering contrast agents.

Radiologists should assess each patient's individual risk factors  including their renal function  before administering contrast media.  In general  the ESUR guidelines recommend that radiologists follow standard protocols for contrast media administration  including recording patient reactions [Chunk 0: ""Record the reaction•	Record the contrast agent name and dose and the details of the reaction and its treatment in the patient’s records.""]  reviewing treatment protocols regularly [Chunk 0: ""Review of treatment protocols Radiologists and their staff should review treatment protocols regularly (e.g. at 12 monthly intervals)  so that each can accomplish their role efficiently.""]  warming iodine-based contrast media before administration [Chunk 0: ""Warming iodine-based contrast medium before administration - •	Appears to make the patient more comfortable  based on clinical observation. •	Reduces viscosity and may reduce the risk of contrast medium extravasation. •	May reduce the rate of general adverse events  but data on this is limited. •	Is widely regarded as best practice.""]  and taking precautions in cases of extravascular administration [Chunk 0: ""A.1.4.	 Extravascular administration of an iodine-based contrast medium - •	When absorption or leakage into the circulation is possible  take the same precautions as for intravascular administration.""].  It is also important to note that the guidelines do not recommend fasting before administration of low- or iso-osmolar non-ionic iodine-based contrast media or of gadolinium-based agents [Chunk 0: ""A.1.5.	 Fasting before administration of contrast agents Fasting before intravenous administration of contrast agents dates from the time when high-osmolar iodine-based contrast media were used and many patients vomited. Fasting is not recommended before administration of low- or iso-osmolar non-ionic iodine-based contrast media or of gadolinium-based agents.""].  In summary  while the ESUR guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for patients with active multiple sclerosis  radiologists should still follow standard protocols and assess individual patient risk factors before administering contrast media.",,17.15
How should gadolinium contrast be administered in patients with Parkinson’s disease according to ESUR?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for administering gadolinium contrast in patients with Parkinson's disease. The guidelines primarily focus on renal adverse reactions to gadolinium-based contrast media and do not provide specific guidance for patients with Parkinson's disease.  However  it is essential to note that the guidelines do discuss gadolinium retention in the brain (C.7.1)  which may be relevant to patients with Parkinson's disease. The guidelines state that high signal intensity in the deep brain nuclei on MRI has been reported after all linear gadolinium-based agents  but not after macrocyclic agents (C.7.1.3).  In general  the administration of gadolinium contrast should follow the standard guidelines for patients with normal or moderately reduced renal function (GFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) or severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) or on dialysis  as outlined in section B.3.,"{""context_relevant"": ""Yes""  ""question_answered_fully"": ""Yes""  ""used_context_chunks"": [0  1  2]}","Here is the enhanced answer with citations:  According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for administering gadolinium contrast in patients with Parkinson's disease.
