According to the guidelines  how do i have to adjust contrast dose for actively bleeding patients  since they lose contrast through the bleed?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for adjusting contrast dose for actively bleeding patients. The guidelines do not provide guidance on this specific scenario.  However  it's important to note that the guidelines do emphasize the importance of considering individual patient factors  such as renal function  when determining the appropriate contrast dose (B.2. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO IODINE-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA).  In general  the guidelines recommend that radiologists and their staff review treatment protocols regularly to ensure that they are prepared to handle adverse contrast-related events (A.1.2.4. Review of treatment protocols).  It's also worth noting that the guidelines do provide guidance on other aspects of contrast administration  such as warming iodine-based contrast medium before administration (A.1.3.)  extravascular administration of contrast medium (A.1.4.)  and fasting before administration of contrast agents (A.1.5.).

At what point do the ESUR guidelines recommend switching from MRI to CT if a sedated patient becomes agitated mid-procedure?,The ESUR guidelines do not specifically recommend switching from MRI to CT if a sedated patient becomes agitated mid-procedure. The guidelines primarily focus on the use of iodine-based contrast media and the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in at-risk patients.  In emergency or elective examinations  the guidelines suggest considering alternative imaging methods not using iodine-based contrast media (B.2.2  page 19). However  they do not provide guidance on switching between MRI and CT scans in response to patient agitation.  It is essential to prioritize patient safety and comfort during imaging procedures. If a sedated patient becomes agitated  the imaging team should assess the situation and take appropriate measures to ensure the patient's well-being. This may involve adjusting the sedation  repositioning the patient  or interrupting the procedure if necessary.  In such cases  the decision to switch from MRI to CT or to continue with the original imaging modality should be made on a case-by-case basis  taking into account the patient's condition  the clinical question being addressed  and the availability of resources. The ESUR guidelines do not provide specific guidance on this scenario.,"{""context_relevant"": ""No""  ""question_answered_fully"": ""Yes""  ""used_context_chunks"": []}",The ESUR guidelines do not specifically recommend switching from MRI to CT if a sedated patient becomes agitated mid-procedure.
