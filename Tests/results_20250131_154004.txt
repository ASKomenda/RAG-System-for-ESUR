What do i do when a patient exhibits an anaphylactoid reaction?,What do i do when a patient exhibits an anaphylactoid reaction?,According to the ESUR guidelines  when a patient exhibits an anaphylactoid reaction  you should:  1. Call for a resuscitation team. 2. Suction the airway as needed. 3. Elevate the patient's legs if they are hypotensive. 4. Administer oxygen by mask (6-10 l/min). 5. Give intramuscular adrenaline (1:1 000) - 0.5 ml (0.5 mg) in adults  and repeat as needed. For pediatric patients  the dose is: 	* 0.3 ml (0.3 mg) intramuscularly for 6-12 years old 	* 0.15 ml (0.15 mg) intramuscularly for < 6 years old 6. Administer intravenous fluids (e.g.  normal saline  Ringer's solution) up to 2 liters. 7. Give an H1-blocker  such as diphenhydramine 25-50 mg intravenously.

What do i do when a patient exhibits generalized urticaria after a contrast-CT? Do i give Antihistamines?,What do i do when a patient exhibits generalized urticaria after a contrast-CT? Do i give Antihistamines?,According to the ESUR guidelines  when a patient exhibits generalized urticaria after a contrast-CT  it is classified as a hypersensitivity/allergy-like reaction  specifically a moderate reaction (Grade 1  Ring and Messmer classification) (Chapter A.1  page 5).  In this case  antihistamines can be considered as a treatment option. The guidelines do not provide specific guidance on the treatment of acute adverse reactions  but antihistamines are commonly used to treat urticaria and other hypersensitivity reactions.  It is essential to monitor the patient closely  as what initially appears to be a mild or moderate reaction may develop into a more severe reaction (Chapter A.1  page 5). Additionally  it is crucial to rule out other causes of the reaction  as not all symptoms experienced by patients in the hour after contrast agent injection are adverse reactions to the contrast agent (Chapter A.1  page 5).  If the reaction is severe or if there are concerns about the patient's condition  further evaluation and treatment should be guided by local protocols and medical expertise.,"{""context_relevant"": ""Yes""  ""question_answered_fully"": ""Yes""  ""used_context_chunks"": [0  2]}","Here is the enhanced answer with exact citations from the provided context chunks:  When a patient exhibits generalized urticaria after a contrast-CT  it is classified as a hypersensitivity/allergy-like reaction  specifically a moderate reaction (Grade 1  Ring and Messmer classification) as stated in Chunk 1: ""Grade 1: Dermal: Pruritus  Flushing  Urticaria  Angioedema; ..."".

What do i do when a patient exhibits bronchospasm and a laryngeal edema?,What do i do when a patient exhibits bronchospasm and a laryngeal edema?,According to the ESUR guidelines  when a patient exhibits bronchospasm and laryngeal edema  you should follow the guidelines for both conditions.  For bronchospasm (Chapter A  page 9):  1. Administer oxygen by mask (6-10 l/min). 2. Use a β-2-agonist metered dose inhaler (2-3 deep inhalations). 3. Consider administering adrenaline (intramuscularly): 	* For adults: 0.1-0.3 ml (0.1-0.3 mg) [use a smaller dose in patients with coronary artery disease or elderly patients]. 	* For pediatric patients (6-12 years): 50% of the adult dose.  For laryngeal edema (Chapter A  page 9):  1. Administer oxygen by mask (6-10 l/min). 2. Give intramuscular adrenaline (1:1 000): 	* For adults: 0.5 ml (0.5 mg) - repeat as needed. 	* For pediatric patients: 		+ 6-12 years: 0.3 ml (0.3 mg) intramuscularly. 		+ < 6 years: 0.15 ml (0.15 mg) intramuscularly.  Remember to monitor the patient's response to these treatments and adjust as necessary. If the patient's condition worsens or does not respond to these measures  consider calling for a resuscitation team and treating as for anaphylaxis.,"{""context_relevant"": ""Yes""  ""question_answered_fully"": ""Yes""  ""used_context_chunks"": [0  1  2]}","Here is the enhanced answer with exact citations from the provided context chunks:  When a patient exhibits bronchospasm and laryngeal edema  you should follow the guidelines for both conditions.
