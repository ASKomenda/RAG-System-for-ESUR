What do the ESUR guidelines recommend as treatment for a patient exhibiting a generalized anaphylactoid reaction after contrast administration?,What do the ESUR guidelines recommend as treatment for a patient exhibiting a generalized anaphylactoid reaction after contrast administration?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for a patient exhibiting a generalized anaphylactoid reaction after contrast administration  the recommended treatment is as follows:  * For severe reactions (Grade 3 and 4)  immediate treatment is necessary. This includes calling for emergency medical help  administering oxygen  and establishing an airway. Adrenaline (epinephrine) should be given intramuscularly  and the patient should be monitored for cardiac and respiratory function. (Chapter A  page 5)  Additionally  the guidelines emphasize the importance of being aware that what initially appears to be a mild reaction may develop into a more serious reaction  and that not all symptoms experienced by patients in the hour after contrast agent injection are adverse reactions to the contrast agent. (Chapter A  page 5)  It is also important to note that patient anxiety may cause symptoms after contrast agent administration (Lalli effect)  and that when a new contrast agent is first introduced to a department  adverse effects tend to be over-reported (Weber effect).

However  it is mentioned in Chapter 3.2 of the ESUR guidelines  ""Acute Reactions to Contrast Media: Diagnosis and Management"" (page 14)  that the treatment of anaphylactoid reactions involves:  * ""Immediate administration of oxygen  adrenaline (epinephrine)  and antihistamines"" * ""Corticosteroids and bronchodilators may also be necessary"" * ""In severe cases  intensive care unit (ICU) admission may be required""  It is essential to note that the specific treatment may vary depending on the severity and type of reaction  as well as the patient's medical history and condition.

What do the ESUR guidelines recommend as treatment for a patient exhibiting urticaria after contrast administration?,What do the ESUR guidelines recommend as treatment for a patient exhibiting urticaria after contrast administration?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for a patient exhibiting urticaria after contrast administration  the recommended treatment is based on the severity of the reaction.  For mild urticaria (Grade 1)  the guidelines suggest antihistamines as the first line of treatment (Chapter A.1.2.1  page 7).   If the urticaria is marked (Moderate  Grade 2)  corticosteroids may be added to the treatment regimen.  It is essential to note that the management of acute adverse reactions is the same for iodine- and gadolinium-based and ultrasound contrast agents (Chapter A.1.2  page 7).  Additionally  it is crucial to be aware that what initially appears to be a mild reaction may develop into a more severe reaction  and patient anxiety may also contribute to symptoms (Chapter A.1  page 5).,"{""context_relevant"": ""Yes""  ""question_answered_fully"": ""No""  ""used_context_chunks"": [0  1]}",According to the ESUR guidelines  for a patient exhibiting urticaria after contrast administration  the recommended treatment is based on the grade of the reaction according to the Ring and Messmer classification.  For a Grade 1 reaction  which includes urticaria  the recommended treatment is antihistamines and/or corticosteroids (Chapter D  page 36).  It is also important to note that the guidelines recommend skin testing to categorize the reaction as either allergic or non-allergic hypersensitivity  and to look for cross-reactivity so that a safer contrast agent can be recommended for future injections (Chapter D  page 37).  Additionally  the guidelines suggest that the patient should be informed about the reaction and the recommended treatment  and a suitable letter should be provided for the patient to take to the allergy consultation (Chapter D  page 36).,"Here is the revised output:  Reformulated Question: What are the ESUR guidelines for managing urticaria reactions to contrast media in radiology patients?
