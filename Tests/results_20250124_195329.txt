Call for resuscitation team.,What do the ESUR guidelines recommend as treatment for a patient exhibiting a generalized anaphylactoid reaction after contrast administration? 1. Call for resuscitation team.,According to the ESUR guidelines  in the event of a generalized anaphylactoid reaction after contrast administration  the recommended treatment is not to call for a resuscitation team as the first step.  Instead  the guidelines recommend following the simple guidelines for first-line treatment of acute reactions to all contrast agents (Chapter A  page 7-8). This includes:  1. Checking for skin erythema  urticaria  nausea  vomiting  decreased blood pressure  abnormal heart rate  dyspnea  and bronchospasm. 2. Providing supportive treatment  such as oxygen  and administering first-line emergency drugs  including adrenaline 1:1 000  antihistamine H1  and atropine  as necessary.  The resuscitation team should be available in the department  and emergency numbers should be readily accessible in the examination room. However  calling the resuscitation team is not the first step in managing a generalized anaphylactoid reaction.  It is essential to follow the guidelines for first-line treatment and to have the necessary equipment and drugs available in the examination room to ensure prompt and effective management of acute adverse reactions.,"{""context_relevant"": ""Yes""  ""question_answered_fully"": ""No""  ""used_context_chunks"": [0  9]}","According to the ESUR guidelines  in the event of a generalized anaphylactoid reaction after contrast administration  the recommended treatment is to follow the standard anaphylaxis treatment protocol  which includes:  1.

Administer corticosteroids  This is stated in the ESUR guidelines  Chapter 7  ""Contrast Medium Reactions""  page 54.

What do the ESUR guidelines recommend as treatment for a patient exhibiting urticaria after contrast administration? Scattered  protracted or generalized or angioedema:,What do the ESUR guidelines recommend as treatment for a patient exhibiting urticaria after contrast administration? Scattered  protracted or generalized or angioedema:,According to the ESUR guidelines  for a patient exhibiting urticaria after contrast administration  which is classified as a hypersensitivity/allergy-like reaction  the recommended treatment is as follows:  * For mild urticaria (Grade 1)  treatment is not usually necessary  but antihistamines may be given to relieve symptoms (Chapter A.1  page 5). * For marked urticaria (still Grade 1)  antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may be administered (Chapter A.1  page 5). * For angioedema  treatment with antihistamines  corticosteroids  and/or adrenaline may be necessary (Chapter A.1  page 5).  It is essential to note that the patient should be closely monitored  as what initially appears to be a mild reaction may develop into a more severe reaction (Chapter A.1  page 5).  Additionally  the guidelines recommend that patients with a previous history of contrast agent reaction should be evaluated  and skin testing may be performed to categorize the reaction as either allergic or non-allergic hypersensitivity and to look for cross-reactivity  in order to choose a safer contrast agent for future examinations (Chapter A.1  page 5).,"{""context_relevant"": ""Yes""  ""question_answered_fully"": ""No""  ""used_context_chunks"": [2]}",According to the ESUR guidelines  for a patient exhibiting urticaria after contrast administration  which is classified as a non-severe reaction  the recommended treatment is antihistamines and/or corticosteroids (Chapter 7  page 34).  In this case  since the patient has a previous history of contrast agent reaction  it is essential to perform skin testing to categorize the reaction as either allergic or non-allergic hypersensitivity and to look for cross-reactivity. This will help recommend a safer contrast agent for future injections (D. Questionnaires/letters  page 37).  It is also important to note that the referring clinician should complete the relevant questionnaire (D.2 for iodine-based contrast media or D.3 for gadolinium-based contrast agents) to assess the patient's risk factors and medical history before administering contrast agents (D. Questionnaires/letters  pages 38-39).,"Here is the revised output:  Reformulated Question: What are the ESUR guidelines for managing urticaria  angioedema  or other cutaneous reactions following contrast media administration?
