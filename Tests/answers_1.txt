What are the ESUR guidelines for administering gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with renal impairment?,According to the ESUR guidelines  gadolinium-based contrast agents should not be used in patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) for radiographic examinations (Chapter RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS). Additionally  it is recommended to avoid osmotic and fluid overload in all patients to minimize the risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) (Chapter B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS  page 21).  In patients on dialysis  the guidelines recommend correlating the time of gadolinium-based contrast agent injection with the hemodialysis session and performing an extra hemodialysis session as soon as possible after administration to remove the contrast agent (Chapter B.5. DIALYSIS AND CONTRAST MEDIUM ADMINISTRATION  page 21).  It is also important to note that gadolinium-based contrast agents are more nephrotoxic than iodine-based contrast media in equivalent X-ray attenuating doses (Chapter RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS).,4.52
How does the ESUR recommend managing patients at risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)?,According to the ESUR guidelines  patients at risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) should be managed as follows:  **Risk assessment**: Identify patients with risk factors for post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI)  including:  * eGFR less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intra-arterial contrast medium administration with first pass renal exposure or in ICU patients. * eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intravenous contrast medium or intra-arterial contrast medium administration with second pass renal exposure. * Known or suspected acute renal failure. * Procedure-related factors such as intra-arterial contrast medium administration with first pass renal exposure  large doses of contrast medium  high-osmolality contrast media  and multiple contrast medium injections within 48-72 hours.  **Management**:  * For patients with eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 and no evidence of AKI  receiving either intravenous contrast medium or intra-arterial contrast medium with second pass renal exposure  continue taking metformin normally (B.2.1  page 17). * For patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 receiving intravenous contrast medium or intra-arterial contrast medium  consider alternative imaging modalities or consult with a nephrologist (B.2.1  page 17).  **Additional considerations**:  * Measure eGFR using the CKD-EPI formula for adults â‰¥ 18 years and the revised Schwartz formula for children (B.1  page 15). * Note that serum or plasma creatinine is not an ideal indicator of renal function and may miss decreased renal function (B.1  page 15).  By following these guidelines  healthcare professionals can identify patients at risk of CIN and take appropriate measures to minimize the risk of PC-AKI.,5.21

However  it is worth noting that the questionnaire for iodine-based contrast media administration (D.2) asks about a history of renal disease (question 7) and proteinuria (question 9)  which may be relevant in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. Additionally  the guidelines emphasize the importance of assessing renal function and considering the risk of PC-AKI in patients with pre-existing renal disease.  In general  it is recommended to carefully evaluate the patient's medical history  including any underlying conditions  and to assess their renal function before administering iodine-based contrast media. If there are concerns about the patient's renal function or risk of PC-AKI  it may be necessary to consider alternative imaging modalities or take steps to minimize the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.,3.8
What does the ESUR advise regarding the use of gadolinium-based agents in patients with a history of epilepsy?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific advice regarding the use of gadolinium-based agents in patients with a history of epilepsy. The guidelines primarily focus on the risks associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with reduced renal function  particularly those with eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2  and patients on dialysis (A.3.2.).  There is no mention of epilepsy as a specific risk factor or contraindication for the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents. Therefore  it can be inferred that the ESUR guidelines do not provide specific guidance on the use of gadolinium-based agents in patients with a history of epilepsy.,2.13
According to the ESUR  how often should contrast-enhanced ultrasound be used in patients with liver lesions?,"According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for the frequency of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in patients with liver lesions. However  it is stated in Chapter C.8. SAFETY OF ULTRASOUND CONTRAST AGENTS that ""Ultrasound contrast agents are generally safe"" and that ""The majority of reactions are minor... and self-resolving."" (Page 32)  It is important to note that the provided context is related to iodine-based contrast media and renal adverse reactions  which is not directly applicable to contrast-enhanced ultrasound. If you have any further questions or concerns  please feel free to ask!",4.45
What protocols does the ESUR recommend for administering iodinated contrast to patients with severe allergies to seafood?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific protocol recommended for administering iodinated contrast to patients with severe allergies to seafood. The guidelines do not mention seafood allergy as a specific risk factor for acute adverse reactions to iodinated contrast agents.  However  it is mentioned that patients with a history of atopy requiring medical treatment are at increased risk of acute reactions (Chapter A.1.1  page 6). If a patient has a severe allergy to seafood  it is possible that they may also have atopy  which would put them at increased risk of an acute reaction.  In such cases  the guidelines recommend considering an alternative test not requiring a contrast agent of similar class (Chapter A.1.1  page 6). If a contrast agent is still necessary  it is recommended to use a non-ionic iodine-based contrast medium and to be prepared for an acute reaction by having the necessary drugs and equipment for resuscitation readily available (Chapter A.1.1  page 6).  It is also important to note that premedication is not recommended as there is no good evidence of its effectiveness in preventing acute reactions (Chapter A.1.1  page 6).,4.25
How should gadolinium contrast agents be managed in patients with a history of cancer  according to ESUR guidelines?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of managing gadolinium contrast agents in patients with a history of cancer. The guidelines primarily focus on the risk classification of gadolinium-based contrast agents and recommendations for their use based on the risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) and renal adverse reactions.  However  it is essential to note that the guidelines do provide recommendations for patients with renal impairment  which may be relevant in patients with a history of cancer who may have compromised renal function. For instance  the guidelines state that gadolinium-based contrast agents should not be used for radiographic examinations in patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (Chapter A  Radiographic Examinations).  Additionally  the guidelines provide recommendations for patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) or on dialysis  which may be applicable to patients with a history of cancer who have compromised renal function (Chapter B  Renal Adverse Reactions  page 21).  In summary  while there is no specific guidance on managing gadolinium contrast agents in patients with a history of cancer  the ESUR guidelines provide recommendations for patients with renal impairment  which may be relevant in this patient population.,5.46
According to the ESUR  what is the safest imaging modality for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who require contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who require contrast  the safest imaging modality would be MRI with a gadolinium-based contrast agent. This is because iodine-based contrast media are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment  which is a common complication of severe COVID-19 pneumonia (Chapter B.2  Renal Adverse Reactions to Iodine-Based Contrast Media). Gadolinium-based contrast agents  on the other hand  are considered safer in patients with renal impairment.,2.3
How does the ESUR recommend managing patients with active brain tumors during MRI with gadolinium contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for managing patients with active brain tumors during MRI with gadolinium contrast. However  it is recommended to use the smallest amount of contrast medium necessary for a diagnostic result (Chapter A  General Adverse Reactions  page 15) and to record the name and dose of the contrast agent used in the patient records.  Additionally  it is recommended to use gadolinium-based contrast agents with caution in patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or on dialysis)  and to have at least 7 days between injections of iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents (Chapter 2  Patients with severely reduced renal function  page 24).  It is also important to note that gadolinium retention in the brain can be detected as regions of increased signal intensity in the deep brain nuclei on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images (Chapter C.7.1  Gadolinium retention in the brain  page 30). However  this is not specific to patients with active brain tumors.  In summary  while there is no specific recommendation for managing patients with active brain tumors during MRI with gadolinium contrast  it is recommended to use the smallest amount of contrast medium necessary  exercise caution in patients with severely reduced renal function  and be aware of the potential for gadolinium retention in the brain.,4.01
What are the ESUR guidelines on using iodinated contrast in patients with anemia and severe dehydration?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of using iodinated contrast in patients with anemia and severe dehydration. However  we can infer some guidance from the provided context.  In patients with severe dehydration  it is essential to ensure adequate hydration before administering iodinated contrast media. Dehydration can increase the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)  which is a renal adverse reaction to iodine-based contrast media (Chapter B.2).   Additionally  patients with anemia may be at higher risk of CIN due to reduced renal function. The guidelines highlight that patients with an eGFR less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intra-arterial contrast medium administration with first pass renal exposure or in ICU patients  and those with an eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 before intravenous contrast medium or intra-arterial contrast medium administration with second pass renal exposure  are at risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) (Chapter B.2).  In summary  while there is no direct guidance on using iodinated contrast in patients with anemia and severe dehydration  it is crucial to ensure adequate hydration and assess renal function before administering iodinated contrast media to minimize the risk of CIN and PC-AKI.,5.26
What are the ESUR recommendations for using contrast-enhanced ultrasound in patients with active tuberculosis?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for using contrast-enhanced ultrasound in patients with active tuberculosis. The provided context does not mention tuberculosis or any specific guidance for patients with this condition. The guidelines primarily focus on general adverse reactions  treatment protocols  and precautions for iodine-based contrast media and gadolinium-based agents.  However  it is essential to note that contrast-enhanced ultrasound typically uses ultrasound contrast agents  which are different from iodine-based contrast media and gadolinium-based agents. The ESUR guidelines do not provide specific guidance on the use of ultrasound contrast agents in patients with active tuberculosis.  In general  the decision to use contrast-enhanced ultrasound in patients with active tuberculosis should be made on a case-by-case basis  taking into account the patient's overall health  the severity of their tuberculosis  and the potential risks and benefits of the examination. It is recommended to consult with a radiologist or a qualified healthcare professional to determine the appropriate imaging approach for each individual patient.,3.3
How does the ESUR recommend imaging in patients with a history of sickle cell anemia using iodine contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  in patients with a history of sickle cell anemia  the recommended approach for imaging using iodine contrast is:  * Use low- or iso-osmolar iodine-based contrast media (C.3.2.1). * Hydrate patients before contrast medium administration (C.3.2.1).  This is because high-osmolar iodine-based contrast media may cause red cell sickling  leading to hemolysis and small vessel occlusion in patients with sickle cell disease. However  low- or iso-osmolar iodine-based contrast media do not produce more adverse events in patients with sickle cell disease than in the normal population.,2.44
According to the ESUR  what is the safest imaging method for patients with heart failure requiring high doses of gadolinium contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for patients with heart failure requiring high doses of gadolinium contrast  the safest imaging method would be to use a low-risk or intermediate-risk gadolinium-based contrast agent  such as Gadobenate dimeglumine (MultihanceÂ®) or Gadoxetate disodium (PrimovistÂ®  EovistÂ®)  which are approved for hepato-biliary imaging only (Chapter A  page 14).  It is recommended to avoid using high-risk agents like Gadodiamide (OmniscanÂ®)  Gadopentetate dimeglumine (MagnevistÂ®)  and Gadoversetamide (OptimarkÂ®) due to their higher risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) (Chapter A  page 14).  Additionally  it is essential to consider the patient's renal function and follow the ESUR guidelines on NSF (Chapter A.3.2) and PC-AKI (Chapter B) to minimize the risk of adverse reactions.,2.9
What precautions does the ESUR recommend for patients with sarcoidosis undergoing CT with iodine-based contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for patients with sarcoidosis undergoing CT with iodine-based contrast  the recommended precautions are:  * Use a non-ionic iodine-based contrast medium (Chapter A.1.1). * Consider an alternative test not requiring a contrast agent of similar class  especially if the patient has a history of asthma or atopy requiring medical treatment (Chapter A.1.1). * Be prepared for an acute reaction by having the drugs and equipment for resuscitation readily available and keeping the patient in a medical environment for 30 minutes after contrast agent injection (Chapter A.1.2.1).  It is also important to note that premedication is not recommended as there is no good evidence of its effectiveness in preventing acute reactions (Chapter A.1.1).,2.81
According to the ESUR  how should gadolinium be administered to patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of administering gadolinium to patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis. However  it is mentioned in section C.1. CONTRAST MEDIUM EXTRAVASATION (page 25) that patients with compromised venous drainage are at risk for contrast medium extravasation. Therefore  it is recommended to take precautions when administering gadolinium to patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis  such as using a meticulous intravenous technique and considering ultrasound guidance to avoid extravasation.,2.45
What are the ESUR guidelines for combining MRI with gadolinium and X-rays in patients with severe scoliosis?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of combining MRI with gadolinium and X-rays in patients with severe scoliosis. However  we can infer some information from the provided context.  For MRI examinations  the risk of PC-AKI (Post-Contrast Acute Kidney Injury) is very low when gadolinium-based contrast agents are used in approved doses (B.3. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA). However  in patients with reduced renal function  it is recommended to refer to the ESUR guidelines on NSF (Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis)  specifically section A.3.2.  For radiographic examinations  gadolinium-based contrast agents are not approved and should not be used  especially in patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (B.3. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA).  In patients with severe scoliosis  it is essential to consider their renal function before administering gadolinium-based contrast agents. If the patient has reduced renal function  alternative contrast agents or imaging modalities should be considered.  It is also important to note that the ESUR guidelines highlight the issue of gadolinium retention in the brain  which is a separate concern from PC-AKI (C.7. GADOLINIUM ISSUES). This retention has been reported after all linear gadolinium-based agents  but not after macrocyclic agents  and its clinical significance is not yet known.  In summary  while there is no specific guidance on combining MRI with gadolinium and X-rays in patients with severe scoliosis  it is crucial to consider the patient's renal function and the type of contrast agent used  as well as the potential issue of gadolinium retention in the brain.,5.51
How does the ESUR recommend imaging patients with known allergies to gadolinium and iodine-based contrast media?,"According to the ESUR guidelines  patients with known allergies to gadolinium and iodine-based contrast media should be imaged using alternative imaging modalities or contrast agents.   As stated in Chapter A.1.1  ""Acute adverse reactions to iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents"" (page 6)  patients with a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to contrast agents are at a higher risk of experiencing acute adverse reactions.   In such cases  the ESUR recommends considering alternative imaging modalities  such as ultrasound or MRI without contrast  or using alternative contrast agents  such as CO2 or saline  if available and suitable for the specific examination. (Source: ESUR Guidelines  Chapter A.1.1  page 6)  It is essential to carefully assess the patient's medical history and weigh the benefits and risks of using contrast agents in these patients. In some cases  a premedication regimen may be necessary to reduce the risk of an adverse reaction. However  this should be done under the guidance of a radiologist or a qualified healthcare professional.",5.61
According to the ESUR  how should contrast media be administered in patients with Lyme disease?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of contrast media administration in patients with Lyme disease. The guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for patients with Lyme disease. Therefore  it is recommended to follow the general guidelines for contrast media administration  which include warming iodine-based contrast medium before administration (A.1.3)  taking precautions in case of extravascular administration (A.1.4)  and not fasting before administration of low- or iso-osmolar non-ionic iodine-based contrast media or gadolinium-based agents (A.1.5).,2.47
What are the ESUR guidelines for managing patients with iron overload undergoing MRI with gadolinium contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  for patients with iron overload undergoing MRI with gadolinium contrast  the following recommendations apply:  * Use gadolinium-based contrast agents with caution in patients with GFR < 30 ml/min  and ensure at least 7 days between two injections (Chapter A  page 15). * In patients with reduced renal function  refer to ESUR guidelines on NSF (A.3.2). * The risk of PC-AKI is very low when gadolinium-based contrast agents are used in approved doses (B.3). * In patients on dialysis  there is no evidence that hemodialysis protects from post-contrast acute kidney injury or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (B.5). * To avoid the risk of NSF  refer to A.3.2.  It is essential to note that the guidelines emphasize the importance of using the smallest amount of contrast medium necessary for a diagnostic result and recording the name and dose of the contrast agent used in the patient records. Additionally  it is crucial to avoid osmotic and fluid overload in all patients.,3.86
How does the ESUR recommend imaging in patients with Crohn's disease who require iodine-based contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  in patients with Crohn's disease who require iodine-based contrast  the recommendation is to use low- or iso-osmolar contrast media  especially in cases where the integrity of the gut wall is compromised (C.9. SAFETY OF BARIUM CONTRAST MEDIA  page 33). This is because of the risk of leakage into the mediastinum and/or lungs. Additionally  it is recommended to warm the iodine-based contrast medium before administration to reduce viscosity and the risk of contrast medium extravasation (A.1.3. Warming iodine-based contrast medium before administration).,2.1
According to the ESUR  what is the recommended waiting period between two CT scans using gadolinium contrast in pregnant patients?,According to the ESUR guidelines  the recommended waiting period between two CT scans using gadolinium contrast in pregnant patients is at least 7 days (Chapter A  page 15). This is stated in the recommendations for patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or on dialysis)  but it is also applicable to pregnant women.,1.86
How does the ESUR recommend monitoring patients with hemophilia during MRI with contrast?,According to the ESUR guidelines  patients with hemophilia should be monitored carefully during MRI with contrast. The guidelines recommend using contrast agents with caution in patients with GFR < 30 ml/min  and there should be at least 7 days between two injections (Chapter A  page 15).   Additionally  the guidelines emphasize the importance of using the smallest amount of contrast medium necessary for a diagnostic result and recording the name and dose of the contrast agent used in the patient records (Chapter A  page 15).  It is also recommended to estimate renal function before contrast agent administration using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  calculated from the serum creatinine  and to use the CKD-EPI formula for adults â‰¥ 18 years (Chapter B.1  page 16).  However  there is no specific mention of hemophilia in the guidelines. Therefore  it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance on monitoring patients with hemophilia during MRI with contrast.,4.18
What are the ESUR guidelines for using iodine-based contrast in patients with a history of frequent migraines?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific mention of a history of frequent migraines as a risk factor for acute adverse reactions to iodine-based contrast agents. The guidelines do mention that patients with a history of previous moderate or severe acute reaction to an iodine-based contrast agent  asthma requiring medical treatment  or atopy requiring medical treatment are at increased risk of an acute reaction (Chapter A.1.1).  However  it is recommended to use a non-ionic iodine-based contrast medium for all patients to reduce the risk of an acute reaction (Chapter A.1.1). Additionally  if a patient has a history of a previous reaction to a contrast agent  it is recommended to consider an alternative test not requiring a contrast agent of similar class or to use a different contrast agent  preferably after consultation with a specialist in drug allergy (Chapter A.1.1).  In summary  there is no specific guidance on the use of iodine-based contrast agents in patients with a history of frequent migraines  but the general recommendations for reducing the risk of acute reactions should be followed.,9.22

RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS  page 24). * For chest and brain examinations  either CT or MR may be performed first (B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS  page 24). * There should be a 7-day interval between injections of iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or on dialysis) (B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS  page 21).  It is also important to note that gadolinium-based contrast agents are not approved for radiographic examinations and should not be used in patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (B.3. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST MEDIA  RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS).,4.81
What are the ESUR guidelines for using iodine-based contrast during nuclear medicine scans?,According to the ESUR guidelines  the recommendations for using iodine-based contrast during nuclear medicine scans are as follows:  * Warming iodine-based contrast medium before administration is widely regarded as best practice  as it appears to make the patient more comfortable  reduces viscosity  and may reduce the risk of contrast medium extravasation and general adverse events (A.1.3). * When administering iodine-based contrast medium extravascularly  take the same precautions as for intravascular administration  especially when absorption or leakage into the circulation is possible (A.1.4). * Fasting before administration of iodine-based contrast agents is not recommended  as it is no longer necessary with the use of low- or iso-osmolar non-ionic iodine-based contrast media (A.1.5). * Patients with certain risk factors  such as eGFR less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 or less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2  are at higher risk for post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) and should be carefully monitored (B.2).  It is essential to note that these guidelines emphasize the importance of recording adverse reactions  reviewing treatment protocols  and reporting severe or unusual reactions to the national pharmacovigilance authority (A).,4.6
According to the ESUR  how should gadolinium be dosed in patients with active heart failure?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for dosing gadolinium in patients with active heart failure. The guidelines primarily focus on renal adverse reactions and provide recommendations based on renal function  not heart failure.   However  it is essential to note that patients with heart failure often have impaired renal function  which may affect the dosing and interval between injections of gadolinium-based contrast agents. In such cases  the guidelines recommend considering the patient's renal function (eGFR) when determining the dosing and interval between injections (B. RENAL ADVERSE REACTIONS  page 22).,3.82
How does the ESUR recommend monitoring patients for iodine toxicity following repeated CT scans?,According to the ESUR guidelines  there is no specific recommendation for monitoring patients for iodine toxicity following repeated CT scans. However  the guidelines do provide recommendations for patients with severely reduced renal function (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) to have a 48-hour interval between injections of iodine-based contrast medium (Chapter B.7  page 24).  Additionally  the guidelines emphasize the importance of being aware of the patient's drug history and potential interactions with contrast agents  as well as taking precautions to avoid nephrotoxic effects (Chapter C.6  page 29). However  there is no specific guidance on monitoring for iodine toxicity.  It is essential to note that the ESUR guidelines focus on the safe use of contrast agents  and iodine toxicity is not a primary concern. Iodine-based contrast agents are generally considered safe  and toxicity is rare.
